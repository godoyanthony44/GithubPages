    <p>I build and design websites</p>

    <p1>About Me:</p1>
    <br>
    <p2>
       Hi, I'm Anthony. I'm a multi-talented human with over 4+ years of experience in a wide range of
        tech/design occupations.
        <br> <br>
        I grew up in the San Diego Greater Area, more specifically in City Heights. Growing up
        in a very diverse environment created the way I looked at opportunities in life, the belief
        that I can do whatever I set my mind to.
        <br><br>
        Throughout my life as a child, I've always been interested in technology, from the way magnets work at the age of 5,
        to how to program autonomous robots at the age of 13, and even winning 1st place at the iARoC 2017 Robotics Competition.
        Till now, where I continue to learn everyday creating and coding websites. My expertise are diverse, but I am a classically trained
        Web Developer by heart.
        <br> <br>
        (The languages which I have familiarity in are C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have had the most experience
        with Java, HTML, and CSS with over 4+ years of Java experience)
        <br> <br>
        I am on track to becoming CompTIA A+ certified as well as having a certification in FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.
        <br> <br>
        I have also had 3 internships in the past years over the summer which have taught me how to design and create mobile apps,
        how to use Github in a business environment, as well as how to properly teach students to problem solve with programming,
        because as I like to say, Programming is 90% problem solving and 10% coding.
        <br> <br>
